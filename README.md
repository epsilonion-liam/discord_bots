# discord_bots
This repository is created to try and help others with premium apps and subscriptions as the documentation is lacking some what and there is no sandboxing for setting up premium app's.

I am using:

*  Python
*  Nextcord as discord.py is no longer maintained.


When testing the full Workflow and ubscribing to the bot you will have to wait a month for it to be deleted when cancelling the subscription!.
